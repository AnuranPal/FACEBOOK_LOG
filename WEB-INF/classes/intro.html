	    <p>Html is the language of browsers.Whenever you open a webpage in a browser,it is html(along with some other languages) what is running in the background.
		To see the html code of any webpage just right click on the page and then click on "view page source" option.Html is content descriptive language which specifies 
		the positions of the components in an webpage,that is,where we should write the title,header,footer etc(you may say html creates the webpage structure).
		</p>
        <p>The word "HTML" stands for "<b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>".<b>Hypertext</b> means the text with the capability to link to other text.
		<br><b>Markup Language</b>=> A markup language is a language that annotates text so that the computer can manipulate the text. Most markup languages are human readable
		because the annotations are written in a way to distinguish them from the text. For example, with HTML, XML, and XHTML, the markup tags are < and >. Any text that appears 
		within one of those characters is considered part of the markup language and not part of the annotated text.Markup doesnâ€™t have to be computer readable. Annotations done
		in print or in a book are also markup. For example, many students in school will highlight certain phrases in their text books. This indicates that the highlighted text
		is more important than the surrounding text. The highlight color is markup.
		
        Markup becomes a language when rules are codified around how to write and use the markup. That same student could have their own "note taking markup language" if 
		they codified rules like "purple highlighter is for definitions, yellow highlighter is for exam details, and pencil notes in the margins are for additional resources."
		But most markup languages are defined by an outside authority for use by many different people.
